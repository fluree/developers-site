# Get Started

We'll be making a Fluree database that allows users to vote on changes. At the end of the example, user will be able to propose changes, vote on those changes, and create various voting threshholds (minimum votes and minimum win percentage) for different predicates. There are various ways to enable a rule governance scheme, but this is one simple way.

Before you start with this example, you should have a good understanding of [transacting](/guides/transactions/1.md), [creating a schema](/guides/schema/1.md), and the basics around how [smart functions](/guides/advanced/smart-functions/1.md) work.

When creating an application, we should build our application in four steps:

1. Create a schema (no smart functions yet!)
2. Add sample/initial data
3. Create auth/roles/rules
4. Add smart functions from simplest to most complicated

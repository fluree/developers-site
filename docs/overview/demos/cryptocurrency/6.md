# Creating Rules - Part 2

In the previous lesson, we added the following restriction:

- `wallet/name` - only the owner of the wallet can edit

Now, we'll add the next two restrictions.

- `wallet/balance` - anyone can edit
- `wallet/user` - no one can edit.

In order to make sure that anyone can edit `wallet/balance`, we can use the built-in smart functions, `["_fn/name", "true"]`, which always returns `true`.

Similarly, to make sure no one can edit `wallet/user`, we can use the built-in smart function `["_fn/name", "false"]`.

See if you can create two rules, for each rule you need to specify the following:

- id : Names for the rules. We can call one `editAnyCryptoBalance`, and the other `cantEditWalletUser`.
- doc : Description of this rule
- fns : A reference to any smart functions. We can reference the relevant smart functions with a unique two-tuple, `["_fn/name", "true"]` or `["_fn/name", "false"]`
- ops : An array of operations that this rule would apply to. We'll be using either "query", "transact", or "all"
- collection : Name of the collection this rule applies to
- predicates : An array of the names of the predicates this rule applies to.
- errorMessage : An optional error message that would appear if someone is attempting a transaction that is not allowed according to the given rule.

(See all [_rule predicates](/concepts/infrastructure/system_collections.md#_rule)).

<h3>Create Two Rules</h3>
<p>Using the instructions above, create two rules, one that allows anyone to edit `wallet/balance`, and the other that doesn't let anyone edit `wallet/user`.</p>

# Function: Balance Spent = Balance Received

The last and final smart function that we need to add is to make sure that balance spent is equal to balance received.

In order to create this restriction, we need to add a smart function to the `wallet/balance` predicate. However, instead of adding the smart function to the `_predicate/spec`, we need to add it othe `_predicate/txSpec`. The `_predicate/txSpec` runs once per transaction where `wallet/balance` appears, regardless of how many times `wallet/balance` appears in the transaction.

When writing a `_predicate/txSpec`, we have access to two context-dependant functions, `objT` and `objF`. `objT` is the sum of all the [flakes](/concepts/core-concepts/flakes.md) relating to a single predicate (in this case, `wallet/balance`) that are being added during this block, and `objF` is the sum of all flakes being retracted.

To illustrate how this works, we'll use different data than the data in our ledger from this lesson Let's say that the below table is everyone's balances prior to any transactions:
<br/>
<br/>

| Name | Balance |
| ---- | ------- |
| Bob  | 200     |
| Jane | 140     |
| June | 50      |
| Jone | 60      |

<br/>
<br/>
Bob pays Jane 20, pays June 10, and pays Jone 15. In total Bob paid 45. In our ledger, every person's previous balance is retracted, and their new balance is asserted.
<br/>
<br/>

| Name | Retracted | Asserted | Total Change |
| ---- | --------- | -------- | ------------ |
| Bob  | 200       | 155      | -45          |
| Jane | 140       | 160      | 20           |
| June | 50        | 60       | 10           |
| Jone | 60        | 75       | 15           |
| Sum  | 450       | 450      | 0            |

<br/>
<br/>

We see that the sum of all the balance retracted should equal the balance of all the balance asserted. In other words, after money is done being traded hands, we expect the total sum of money belonging to all participants to be equal. Below is the transaction to create a new smart function, and add it to `wallet/name`.

```json
[
  {
    "_id": "_fn$evenCryptoBalance",
    "name": "evenCryptoBalance?",
    "code": "SMART FUNCTION CODE HERE",
    "doc": "The values of added and retracted crypto/balance flakes need to be equal"
  },
  {
    "_id": ["_predicate/name", "wallet/balance"],
    "txSpec": ["_fn$evenCryptoBalance"],
    "txSpecDoc": "The values of added and retracted crypto/balance flakes need to be equal"
  }
]
```

As you can see above, there is no smart function code. That is up to you. You will need to write a relevant smart function using `objT`, `objF`, and one or more of the below [Universal SmartFunctions](/overview/schema/smartfunctions.mdx#universal-functions) to write, `subtractOwnAddOthers?`. `objT` and `objF` take no arguments, and are called as follows: `(objT)` or `(objF)`.

| Function | Arguments       | Example           |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| `inc`    | `n` optional    | `(inc)`           |
| `dec`    | `n` optional    | `(dec)`           |
| `==`     | `arg1 arg2 ...` | `(== 1 1 1 1)`    |
| `+`      | `arg1 arg2 ...` | `(+ 1 2 3)`       |
| `-`      | `arg1 arg2 ...` | `(- 10 9 3)`      |
| `*`      | `arg1 arg2 ...` | `(* 90 10 2)`     |
| `/`      | `arg1 arg2 ...` | `(/ 36 3 4)`      |
| `>`      | `arg1 arg2 ...` | `(> 90 10 2)`     |
| `<`      | `arg1 arg2 ...` | `(< 90 10 2)`     |
| `>=`     | `arg1 arg2 ...` | `(>= 90 90 10 2)` |
| `<`      | `arg1 arg2 ...` | `(< 2 10 90)`     |
| `<=`     | `arg1 arg2 ...` | `(<= 2 10 90 90)` |
| `max`    | `arg1 arg2 ...` | `(max 1 2 3)`     |
| `min`    | `arg1 arg2 ...` | `(min 1 2 3)`     |

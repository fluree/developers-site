# Add Sample/Initial Data

Now, we need to add in our sample data. For the purposes of this example, we'll be creating two users, one with the username `cryptoMan` and the other with the username `cryptoWoman`.

To create a `_user`, we only need to specify a `username`. To create a wallet, we should specify:

- A `name`: we can call thes wallets, `cryptoMan` and `cryptoWoman`
- A `balance`: give each wallet 200
- A `user`: this is a reference to the relevant `_user`s we just created. To reference them properly, you'll need to use [tempids](/overview/transact/basics.md#temporary-ids)

<div class="challenge">

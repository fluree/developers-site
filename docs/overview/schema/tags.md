# _tag

Tags are a special type. A tag only has two built-in predicates, `id` and `doc`.
You can treat a tag as a string, but an object of type `tag` actually creates a
new subject.

Predicate | Type | Description
-- | -- | --
`id` | `string` | Namespaced tag id
`doc` | `string` | Optional docstring for tag

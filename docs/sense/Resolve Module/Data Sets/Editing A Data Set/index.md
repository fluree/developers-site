Once a Data Set is added, it appears in the Data Set list screen. Depending on the processes that have run on it, you can view the Data Set columns, Sample, etc. If the Data Set registration job is complete, you will also be able to see the latest Concepts to which that Data Set’s columns are mapped.  
  
Editing a Data Set is simply the process of going into the tabs of the Data Set shown below i.e. Data Set Attributes, Data Set Sample, Data Set Relationships, Data Refresh, Data Entitlements, Related Projects and Data Quality.  
  
Of these, it is mainly in the Data Set Entitlements, Data Set Attributes, and Data Set Refresh that you’re editing certain aspects, and are taken in separate ongoing sections.  
  
However, to edit the Name and Description of the Data Set, you simply need to go to the header area on any of the Data Set Detail tabs and edit them by clicking on the pencil icon and saving changes. You’ll require **Data Set Admin** rights to edit these fields, or else the icon will be disabled.

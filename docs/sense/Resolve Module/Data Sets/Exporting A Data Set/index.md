You can export a Data Set if you have access to it. Currently, the _Export_ function just exports the Data Set summary.  
  
To export a Data Set, simply click on the _Export_ link in the ellipsis menu beside that Data Set in the _Data Set List_ screen. You will soon get the download prompt and be able to download the summary file of the Data Set.

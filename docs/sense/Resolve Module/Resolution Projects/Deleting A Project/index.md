A user may wish to Delete a _Resolve_ Project as part of a normal Cleanup. This is a soft delete, but currently, there is no way to retrieve the Project from the UI. Deletion of the Project removes it from Display in the project list. 

**Steps to Delete a Project:**

1. One needs to have the Project Admin role for that Project to be able to Delete it.  

3. Browse to the “Project List" screen. 

5. Open the “Quick Menu” for your specific Project by clicking the ellipsis icon. 

7. Click on the “Delete Link” to delete the project.

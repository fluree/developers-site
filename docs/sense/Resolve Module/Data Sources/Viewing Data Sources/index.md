_Fluree Sense_ allows users to access Data from various cloud-based and on-prem environments such as Databricks, Cloud Storage, Hadoop, Snowflake, or traditional RDBMS such as Microsoft SQL etc. In this section, we will explore the screen where you have a holistic view of all the data sources.

A user can go to the Data Source home page by clicking on the Data Source tab on the left panel of the screen:

The user will be taken to the Data Source home screen on which they will see all the Data Sources that they have access to. This screen will have the main facts about each Data Source, including:  

1. The Data Source name(s)

3. The Data Source type

5. Who created the Data Source

7. The number of datasets in that Data Source

9. The number of group entitlements associated with that Data Source

11. The number of user entitlements to the content files of that Data Source

The user can see detailed info about a Data Source by clicking on that specific Data Source. It is only clickable for a user who is the Data Source Admin of that Data Source; otherwise, it will be disabled. This can be seen in the screen above where the logged-in user is NOT the _Data Source Admin_ for two of the Data Sources marked in red.

However, in case you are the Data Source Admin and you click on the Data Source name, the following screen opens up.

1. The Name and Description of the Data Source

3. Data Source type

5. Who Created the Data Source

7. The Last updated date

9. All the files within the Data Source

11. The Data Source connection details

13. The Data Source Entitlements

The user can also manage and edit the Data Source entitlements by clicking on the Manage Access button on the right-hand panel.

Another important view of Golden Records that users may want to see is the Golden Records _Lineage view_. As the name suggests, this view shows which specific records across the source systems have been combined to create the Golden Records after the resolving and mastering operations.

After opening a specific Golden Record, you can click on the _Lineage_ tab to get this view.

In the image above, the values in highlighted background color indicate that they’ve been selected for the Golden Record.

If a user edits a Golden record providing value for an attribute from his / her own side - rather than choosing from the list, the lineage for that Golden Record will display a new row with that specific column highlighted and the source showing as the user.

**Note:** Above example is only for illustration purposes and the data is neither actual nor implies an actual client relationship.

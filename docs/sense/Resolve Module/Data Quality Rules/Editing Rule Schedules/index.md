We’ve talked about the various options which come with Rule Scheduling in the earlier section. Now, let’s see how a user can edit existing Rule Schedule(s). This feature is available to the _Rule Admin_ of the rule, otherwise the relevant icon / button remains disabled.

Rule Schedules can be edited:

- One at a time

- In Bulk

**Editing a Single Rule Schedule**

To edit the Rule Schedule of a _Single Business or Technical rule_:

1. Select the rule from the grid. This can be a Business or Technical View.  
    

3. Click on the ‘Run Schedule’ tab of the rule in the right panel. You’ll see the existing Rule Schedule in view mode. The Rule schedule may correspond to ‘Once’ which essentially means there is no schedule – the rule is supposed to run once in an ad-hoc manner depending on whether Re-run Rule or Save & Run is pressed. Alternately the rule will be a ‘Scheduled’ one – with options to run it Daily, Weekly, Monthly etc. in a specific repeating pattern and time.  
    

5. Click on the Edit icon on the top-right which will be enabled if you are a Rule Admin for that Rule.  
    

7. In the Edit mode, you can make changes to the schedule, or even toggle from Scheduled to Once or vice-versa.  
    

9. ‘Save & Close’ will be enabled if you’re in the ‘Scheduled’ option because that precludes running Ad-hoc. ‘Save & Run’ will be enabled if you’re in the ‘Once’ option because that includes running ad-hoc once.

**Editing Rule Schedule in Bulk**

To edit the rule schedule of multiple Business or Technical rules in bulk

1. Select multiple rules from the grid. This can be a _Business or Technical View_.  
    

3. Fill the Schedule Details such as Time & Time Zone, Recurrence Pattern etc.  
    

5. Save & Review Changes.

Please refer to the [earlier section](/docs/sense/Resolve%20Module/Data%20Quality%20Rules/Scheduling%20Rules/index.md) where we covered this in detail earlier, to view the screens for individual and bulk schedule editing.

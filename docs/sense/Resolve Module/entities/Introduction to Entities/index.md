An Entity in the _Resolve_ module is the same as what we refer to as _Semantic Objects_ in _Classify_. An Entity can be a uniquely identifiable person, institution or thing and is the business object which may be referenced by multiple data tables (or Data Sets as we call them). For example, let's say we have ‘Customer’ as an _Entity_, and we have a Data Set for ‘Customer Profile’ and another one for ‘Customer Address Information’. In this case, we may arrive at the conclusion that both data sets refer to the same Entity.  
  
The Resolve module is mainly about ‘Resolving’ – generating records of truth or Golden Records for a single Entity from a multitude of scattered, duplicated, haphazard data across multiple Data Sets, which may even come from multiple Data Sources. For this reason, before starting with Resolve projects, let's see how _Entities_ are created, edited and managed.

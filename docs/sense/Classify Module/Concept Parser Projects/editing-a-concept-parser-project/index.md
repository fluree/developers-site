A _Classification_ Project can be edited by any user who has _Project Admin_ rights for that Project. To edit a Classification Project please follow the steps below. Remember that you do NOT need to make changes in all the steps but a specific workflow typically saves on pressing the ‘Next’ button unless it has an ‘Apply Changes’ etc., button available in it.  
  
**Note:** We’ve not added images to most of the steps, as they are nearly the same for the create flow with the obvious difference that the screens load showing the pre-existing values to be edited.

**Step 1. Click on the Edit link of the Project from the Ellipsis menu to Edit.**

You can edit a Project from the Edit link as well as just by clicking on the Project name in the list if it is in Draft mode. You will require Project Admin entitlements to edit a Project.

**Step 2. Edit the name and other Basic Details**

The ‘Project Admin’ can edit the name and description of the Project, and they simply need to press ‘Next Step’ to Save and move ahead.  

**Step 3. Edit the users associated with the Project**

The _Project Admin_ can add or remove users for that Project. The only prerequisite is to follow the validations related to that Project depending on whether its four-eyes ON or OFF.  
It should also be noted that if the Project has run, its four-eyes state **cannot** be changed.

**Step 4 - 7. Edit the Classification Details, Training and Project Data**

These steps are also the same, the only difference being that here we’re defining Data where the next step Data may be dependent on an earlier step, and so will change if some aspects are changed. For example, if the _Classifier_ and _Sub-Concept_ are changed, this change may require changes in the Reference Data Sets, Training Data Sets and Project Data.  
  
To Review the edit flow with images, please re-visit the Create Project flow as the screens are almost exactly the same.

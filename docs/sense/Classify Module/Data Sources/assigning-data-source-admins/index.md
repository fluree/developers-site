When creating a Data Source, or anytime later (as a _Data Source Admin_), a user can assign additional Admins to the Data Source through the screen below. The logged-in user will, for obvious reasons, be automatically moved into the right panel and considered to be the _Data Source Admin._  
  
This screen is accessible during the Data Source creation workflow. Once the connection parameters are defined, the user can click on the Next Step button to reach the third stage of the workflow - which is the _Add Admin Users_ screen.  
  
The existing Data Source Admins can also access the _Add Admin Users_ screen from:

- Edit Data Source workflow

- Edit the Entitlements Link in the Data Source Detail screen.

Apart from getting access to the Data Source to be able to edit its connection properties etc., a _Data Source Admin_ also gets entitled to all the content of the Data Source without the need of specifying explicitly in User Entitlements. Since the role of the _Data Source Admin_ comes with these privileges, it should be chosen carefully.  
  
**Useful Note:** Test _Tenants_ normally come with a default Data Source and all initial users of the tenant get _Data Source Admin_ entitlements to this Data Source, to get you started.

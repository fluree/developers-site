A _Catalog_ is the business data glossary, data dictionary or target data model that will be used as a reference for classifying data. A _Catalog_ is composed of _Semantic Objects_ (or data entities) and their underlying business concepts (or entity attributes). An organization may have multiple _Catalogs_. The _Classify_ system can be trained to independently classify the same object to different data dictionaries, so a _Catalog_ will ultimately be the linkage between the logical business glossary, and the physical meta-data in the Data Lake.  
  
A _Catalog_ ultimately allows businesses to move towards their data discovery and data analysis goals.

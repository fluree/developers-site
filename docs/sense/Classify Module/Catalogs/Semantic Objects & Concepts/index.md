It will be useful to discuss a little about _Semantic Objects_ and _Concepts_ here. As we create the _Catalog_ above, which is like a Data Dictionary of the business - it is pertinent to note the following:

1. _Semantic Objects_ can interchangeably be referred to as Classes or as Entities in the ‘Resolve’ module. They contain attributes or properties which are Concepts. They can be mapped or ‘tagged’ to Datasets.

3. _Concepts_ or _Entity Attributes_ are the main building blocks and get mapped, ‘tagged’ or linked to Dataset columns to discover the underlying data relationships.

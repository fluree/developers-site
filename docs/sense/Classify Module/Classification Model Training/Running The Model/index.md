Another aspect that the user needs to be aware of is that whenever a Run model is activated, whether by _Classifying_ a _Dataset_ or by training a model at the _Object_ or _Concept_ Level, it triggers classification for the whole tenant. This is because the _Concept_ is linked to other _Concepts_, _Data Quality Rules_, Data Sets and any change in that _Concept_ cannot be independent. So, the changes occur across the _Tenant_ in a holistic manner as determined by the machine learning model.

Secondly, any such _Classification_ will internally generate tasks, which are refined predicted mappings generated by the system to train the model further through minimal manual effort.

In the next section, we will look at where these tasks can be found and how they help the user.

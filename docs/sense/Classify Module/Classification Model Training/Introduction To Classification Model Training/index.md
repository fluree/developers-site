In earlier sections for Data Set and _Catalog_, we saw a few ways of _Classification_. These are listed as follows:

1. _Classify_ a Data Set from the Data Set List view.

3. Give Feedback to predictions of Data Set columns in the _Attributes_ tab of a Data Set.

5. Give Feedback to _Catalog_ ad-hoc mappings (Mapped Data Sets, Mapped Data Columns).

7. Give Feedback to _Catalog_ ad-hoc mappings (from _Semantic Object Technical View_).  
      
    Now let us look at another workflow, where users can manually add new or remove prior mappings at the _Concept_ or _Semantic Object_ level, apart from just giving feedback to existing predictions, which is a more direct way of training the _Classification_ model. This corresponds to the 5th way of Giving feedback:  
      
    

9. Give Feedback by adding/removing mappings for a specific _Semantic Object_ or _Concept_:  
      
    a. Through Train model workflow  
    b. Through the _Import Concept Mapping_ feature

And yes, there are even more ways but we’ll take them up, apart from recapping these, in the appropriate sections.

Let’s circle back to the [introduction of this section](https://sensedocsdev.wpengine.com/introduction-to-classification-model-training/) where we recapped the various ways in which we were providing feedback to the system.  
  
If you recall, the [section on Ad-hoc Mappings feedback](https://sensedocsdev.wpengine.com/giving-feedback-to-ad-hoc-mappings/) touched upon how the feedback feature supports multi-user or collaborative feedback.  
  
We’d like to emphasize that this is applicable to all the screens where ad-hoc mapping feedback is provided. This includes the training at the _Concept_ Level, _Semantic Object_ level or in the case of Importing _Concept_ mapping. Here, we’re not visibly seeing the counts or feedback history in the workflow, but once the mappings are provided and the model is run, they get assimilated using the same scoring logic and appear in ad-hoc mappings as confirmed mappings from the user.

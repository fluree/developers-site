A _Synonym_ is defined in English as “a word or phrase that means exactly or nearly the same as another word or phrase.” In the context of the Fluree Sense software as well, a Synonym works the same way.  
  
Let us assume you have two _Catalogs_ of related or the same business. In one of these businesses, they call a paying customer an ‘_Account_’ and in the other, as ‘_Customer_.’ Additionally, assume that in the _Customer Semantic Object_, we have something called _Job_ and, in the _Account Semantic Object_, we have a _Concept_ called _Occupation_. If these two things map to essentially the same or mostly the same data, it is very likely they are _Synonyms_.  
  
Alternatively, if these are confirmed _Synonyms_, we could discover mappings for one based on the other.  
  
This is a very simple example, but there could be many other complex cases. So here, Customer’s _Job_ is _Synonym_ of _Account’s Occupation_.  
  
Imagine trying to discover and make sense of mappings across multiple catalogs, multiple businesses for such inter-related business vocabulary. Wouldn’t it be better if this could be automated by Machine Learning which would not only identify such _Synonyms_ based on their mappings, but also extrapolate mappings on the basis of manually linked Synonyms?  
  
So, let us look at creating some _Synonyms_ in the next section.

There are two types of _Classification_ Projects:

1. **Semantic Object Classifier:** _Classify_ records in a Data Set using a ‘_Classifier_’ for a specific Semantic Object mapped to multiple Data Sets.

3. **Concept Parser:** Parse or split information embedded inside _Concepts_ (through its mapped columns) into multiple new Concepts.

We will cover the first one in this section which allows a user to run _Classification_ on a Selected Semantic Object of a Catalog. **Let’s understand this through an example:**

- In the case of a large Heavy Machinery / Electronics / Manufacturing company, assume there is a huge inventory list and the legacy description and details are non-standardized, haphazard, providing no clue about the Product type. Example:  – Is it a beaker, is it a Pipe, is it a Funnel, is it a Tripod etc. It is difficult for the company to identify  & group individual products. 

- These subcategories of the main product are all _Classes_ or categories to which the main Product (our _Semantic Object_) can be categorized(Classified), based on certain inputs that are other attributes of the Product. The Semantic Object Classification or SOC Project does this very thing.  
    

- Here’s another example: A medical company, which has to categorize patients into Low, Medium or High Risk category for a certain ailment, can do it on the basis of inputs from the Patient data (Our _Semantic Object_). This is again possible by running an SOC Project.

All this would take a long time, if done manually, and the process- prone to oversight and errors, but can be done easily through such a Project set-up.  
  
Now let us cover the workflow of creating a Semantic Object Classifier, also known as the SOC Project.

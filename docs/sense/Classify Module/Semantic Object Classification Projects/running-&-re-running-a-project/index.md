This aspect is common to all projects in general. Projects can be re-run after completing the Tasks generated by them. There may be some validations and restrictions as to the minimum number of Tasks/All Tasks needing to be completed. 

When you run the Project for the first time, it is called an Unsupervised run because no one is supervising the first set of predictions (or task related mappings) that the system generates. Subsequent runs should ideally improve the confidence, if the Tasks are completed and trained correctly.  
  
The Project can be Re-run:

1. After completing all the Tasks from the Tasks list through the Train Model screen.

3. After editing Project and Running at the Last Step OR running from ‘Managing Project Data’.

It is always better to re-run the model only after completing the Tasks.

In the earlier section, we talked about checking and tracking the Jobs you’ve triggered. Additionally, you can also check out details of what is happening in a specific Stage of the job by clicking on the Log button as shown below.

This is especially important if the job fails in a certain step. Click on the Log button and copy the processing details or provide a screenshot to the support team if required, to try and understand why the Job has failed. Let’s see a typical log in the case of a job pertaining to the Data Quality rule in the image below.

**Useful Note:** You can also make adjustments to the Project, Data Set, Data Quality rule, if the error is intuitively understandable and trigger the job again if required. Remember that in some cases, the error may be an environmental issue or just the job getting missed due to some DBR etc. issue where it may show ‘Not Started’ even after a long time, and the job not even showing in Job Queue.  
In such cases, just try to re-trigger the job once.

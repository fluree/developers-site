The Fluree Sense Data Quality feature provides a 360 degree view of the Data Quality of your data. Not only can you view the Data at a Data Set level but also at the _Catalog_ (Data Dictionary), _Semantic_ _Object_ or _Concept_ level. Some of these views also depend on your licensing – for example the _Catalog_, _Semantic_ _Object_ and _Concept_ level views will obviously only be visible if you have the _Classify_ Product licensed.

Each rule view typically shows the Chart displaying the historical runs of the Rule with Data Quality percentage for that View, the Overall Quality Score as well as the Good, Bad and Total Records.

The _Classify_ Product also ships with a very powerful and comprehensive Add-On called _Data Quality_. Data Quality in a nutshell is the 360-degree view of the quality of your data across dimensions such as Timeliness, Accuracy, Validity, Completeness, etc. Any _Data Discovery_, _Classification_ and de-duplication exercise is incomplete without the knowledge of the inherent quality of Data. The Data Quality add-on brings this into the system both at a business-user level and specifically down to tables, joins and filters.

The Data Quality Add-On can thus be a part of both _Classify_ and _Resolve._ In this section, you may see the Data Quality module both in Classify or Resolve sections so it is pertinent to note that it can be taken as a bundled add-on with both or either.  
  
The building blocks for Data Quality in our software will be the Data Quality rules – which is what we’ll be looking into next.

**Prerequisite:** Your Software License should have the Data Quality Add-On which is provided during _Tenant_ creation or can be added later.

# Adding Sample Data

Now that we've created our subjects and our predicates, we can add in sample data to our application.

We can add a new `person` to our ledger the same way that we added a new `_predicate` or a new `_collection`. We need to have an `_id` whose value is the name of the collection that our new subject belongs to (`person`), and then we can add as many keys as predicates we want to specify.

For example, to create two people with `fullName`s and `handle`, we can issue the following transaction:

```json
[{
    "_id": "person",
    "fullName": "Jane Doe",
    "handle": "jdoe"
},
{
    "_id": "person",
    "fullName": "Zach Smith",
    "handle": "zsmith"
}]
```

## Adding Multi Predicates {#adding-multi-predicates}

Some of the predicates that we added are multi predicates, meaning we can add more than one object (value) to that predicate. When creating a `person` and specifying `favNums`, the value for `favNums` needs to be inside of square brackets, `[` and `]`. This is true even if we're only adding one favorite number.

For example:

```json
[{
    "_id": "person",
    "fullName": "Fluree Person",
    "favNums": [1, 14, 28]
}]
```

    <ul>
        <li> A person with the full name, Alton Brown, handle, aBrown, and favorite numbers: 89 and 7</li>
        <li> A person with the full name, Oprah Winfrey, handle, oWinfrey, and favorite numbers: 2, 6 and 908</li>
        <li> A person with the full name, Roger Goodell, handle, rGood, and favorite numbers: 2</li>  
    </ul>

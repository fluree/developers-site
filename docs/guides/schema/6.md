# Adding Sample Data: Part 2

In order to add predicates of type `ref` to our sample data, we can reference existing subjects using their `_id` or a unique two-tuple. We can also reference subjects that haven't been created yet by using their temporary ids.

## Referencing Tempids {#referencing-tempids}

For example, if we want to create a person and artists at the same time, and list those artists in the person's favorite artists, we'll need to use tempids.

```json
[
  {
    "_id": "person",
    "handle": "artSnob",
    "fullName": "Artemus Snoberson",
    "favArtists": ["artist$basquiat", "artist$savage"]
  },
  {
    "_id": "artist$basquiat",
    "name": "Jean-Michel Basquiat"
  },
  {
    "_id": "artist$savage",
    "name": "August Savage"
  }
]
```

<div class="challenge">
<h3>Create 1 New Person and 1 New Artist </h3>
<p>Write a transaction to create the 1 new person and 1 new artist
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li> Person with the full name, Connie Seur, handle, cSuer, favorite numbers: 13, and favorite artists: Gustav Klimt</li>
    </ul>
</p>
</div>

# Adding Data

In addition to an `_id` key, an `_action` key is always included, but typically inferred and thus optional for most operations. If we are adding data, we can include `"_action": "add"`, or we can omit it, as it is inferred. Only one action can be performed per transaction.

In order to add data, you must use a temporary id, i.e. `"chat"`. The temporary id is a string, and has to begin with the collection to which you are adding (for instance `chat`).

Any predicates that you wish to add to this subject should be included as key-value pairs.

The keys can contain the full predicate name including the namespace, i.e. `chat/message` or you can leave off the namespace if it is the same as the collection the subject is within. i.e. when the subject is within the `chat` collection, just message can be used which is translated to `chat/message` by Fluree.

For example, to add a person:

```json
[
  {
    "_id": "person",
    "handle": "aSmith",
    "fullName": "Alan Smith",
    "favNums": [1, 2, 3]
  }
]

// Note that favNums is a multi-cardinality predicate, so it has to be in []
```

If you want to create two new people, you can just put both transactions within the same `[ ]`. Order of the key-value pairs does not matter.

```json
[
  {
    "handle": "aGable",
    "fullName": "Anna Gable",
    "favNums": [28],
    "_id": "person"
  },
  {
    "_id": "person",
    "fullName": "Zack Moon",
    "handle": "zMoon",
    "favNums": [0, -3]
  }
]
```

<p>Using the above transaction examples, create your own person with all of the same predicates.</p>

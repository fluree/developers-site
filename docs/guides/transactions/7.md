# Deleting a Subject

To delete/retract an entire subject, use the \_id key along with only "\_action": "delete". This deletes (retracts) the subject all predicates. In addition, all of the references for that subject anywhere in the ledger are also retracted.

```json
[
  {
    "_id": ["person/handle", "jdoe"],
    "_action": "delete"
  }
]
```

<div class="challenge">
<h3>Delete!</h3>
<h4>Write a transaction</h4>
<br/>
<p>Using the above transaction example, write a transaction deleting the subject with id 12345.</p>
<br/>
</div>

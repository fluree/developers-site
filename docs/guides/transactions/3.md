# Temporary Ids

As mentioned in the previous lesson, a tempid can simply be the collection name, i.e. `_user`.

However, if you would like to reference that tempid somewhere else in your transaction, it is necessary to create a unique tempid. To make a unique tempid, just append the collection with any non-valid collection character (anything other than `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, `_`) followed by anything else. For example, `_user$jdoe` or `_user#1`.

In the below example, we are creating both a person and a chat message. We are using the person's tempid as a reference in `chat/person`.

```json
[
  {
    "_id": "person$joy",
    "handle": "jTan",
    "fullName": "Joy Tan"
  },
  {
    "_id": "chat",
    "message": "This is a message from Joy!",
    "instant": "#(now)",
    "person": "person$joy"
  }
]
```

<div class="challenge">
<h3>Add a Person and a Chat</h3>
<h4>Write a transaction!</h4>
<br/>
<p>Using the above transaction example, create your own person and chat, and reference that person as `chat/person`.</p>
<br/>
</div>

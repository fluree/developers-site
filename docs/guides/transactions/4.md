# Nested Transactions

Another way to create two connected subjects at once is to use nested transactions. Instead of using a tempid, you can add a map that defines the new subject directly inside of another subject, for example:

```json
[
  {
    "_id": "chat",
    "message": "I just want to say hi!",
    "person": {
      "_id": "person",
      "handle": "dLawson",
      "fullName": "Dawson Lawson"
    }
  }
]
```

<div class="challenge">
<h3>Using Nested Transactions, Add a Person and a Chat</h3>
<h4>Write a transaction!</h4>
<br/>
<p>Using the above transaction example, create your own person and chatby nesting the person transaction within the chat transaction.</p>
</div>

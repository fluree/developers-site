# Crawling the Relationships, In Reverse

You can also crawl the graph in reverse. Although there is no predicate that begins with `actor/` that references a subject in `credit` collection, we know that actors are referenced in the credit collection.

In order to select all of the credits that belong to an actor, like- for instance `["actor/name", "Tilda Swinton"]`, we can

```json
{
    "select": ["*", {"credit/_actor": ["*"]}],
    "from": ["actor/name", "Tilda Swinton"]
}
```

Notice that, we use the relevant predicate name, `credit/actor`, but because we are crawling the graph in reverse, we add an, `_` in front of `actor`. We don't switch the order of the original predicate (`actor/credit` or `actor/_credit` are both wrong!), but we do need to add the `_`.

The results will mirror the shape of our query, and use the `credit/_actor` name in showing us our results:

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "result": {
    "credit/_actor": [
      {
        "credit/id": "52fe43cdc3a36847f8070be5",
        "credit/character": "Karen Crowder",
        "credit/order": 2,
        "credit/actor": {
          "_id": 4316442133756
        },
        "_id": 4312147268629
      },
      ...
    ],
    "actor/id": 3063,
    "actor/name": "Tilda Swinton",
    "actor/gender": 1,
    "_id": 4316442133756
  },
  "fuel": 94,
  "block": 3373,
  "time": "188.42ms"
}
```

<div class="challenge">
<h3>Crawl the Graph in Reverse to Get Movie Information.</h3>
<p>The movie collection has a predicate, `movie/productionCompanies`. </p>
<p>Can you select all predicates from the `productionCompany` collection and crawl the graph, in reverse, to get all predicates from each movie?</p>
<p>Remember, we never switch the order of the original predicate. </p>

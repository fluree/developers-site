# Analytical Queries - Example

Take a look at the below query.

```json
{
  "select": "?nums",
  "where": [
    // Clause 1
    ["$fdb", ["person/handle", "zsmith"], "person/favNums", "?nums"],

    // Clause 2
    ["$fdb", ["person/handle", "jdoe"], "person/favNums", "?nums"]
  ]
}

/* Note: In this query, select is not in an array. When selecting only one variable, we can omit the hard brackets */
```

The source for both of the clauses is `$fdb` - the current Fluree.

The first clause has a subject of `["person/handle", "zsmith"]`, and the second clause has a subject of `"person/handle", "jdoe"]`. Both clauses are referring to a different person.

The predicate for both clauses is `person/favNums`.

The object for both clauses is a variable, `?nums`. Remember, that when two clauses include the same variable, then we only keep values that satisfy **ALL** flake patterns.

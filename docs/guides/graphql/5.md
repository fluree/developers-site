# Basic Queries: Part 4

In GraphQL, when a predicate is of type `ref`, you can open up a second set of curly braces, and specify any predicates of the referenced collection inside of the curly braces.

In the below example, `chat/person` is a `ref`, and we want to see all `person/handle`s and person subject ids.

```graphql
{
  graph {
    chat {
      _id
      message
      person {
        _id
        handle
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note: The text editor on the right will show an error when you type a GraphQL query. That's okay! Your answer still might be right!

<div class="challenge">
<h3>Write a Query!</h3>
<br/>
<p>Write a GraphQL query that select all `person/handle`s, `person/fullName`s, `person/favArtists`, and that follows those artists to see `artist/name`.</p>

<p>Use the above query for reference.</p>

</div>

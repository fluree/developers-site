# Transactions

We can perform transactions in GraphQL by passing a variable to a GraphQL mutation. This variable should contain a JSON-formatted parcel of data without line breaks.

As you can see in the below example, in order to add people, we store the JSON-formatted data in a variable called myPeopleTx and use the variable myPeopleTx in the mutation statement.

We also need to ensure that all " are escaped, like so \".

```graphql
mutation addPeople ($myPeopleTx: JSON) {
  transact(tx: $myPeopleTx)
}

{
  "myPeopleTx": "[
    { \"_id\": \"person\", \"handle\": \"jdoe\", \"fullName\": \"Jane Doe\" },
  { \"_id\": \"person\", \"handle\": \"zsmith\", \"fullName\": \"Zach Smith\" }]"
}
```

For the challenge question, you'll be writing the mutation statement. We've provide the escaped transaction as a variable below:

```graphql
{
    "artistTx": "[{\"_id\":\"artist$1\",\"name\":\"Michelangelo\"},{\"_id\":\"artist$2\",\"name\":\"Rembrandt\"},{\"_id\":\"artist$3\",\"name\":\"Monet\"}]"
}
```

<div class="challenge">
<h3>Write a Mutation</h3>
<br/>
<p>Write the mutation statement that would correspond to the above variable, artistTx.</p>

<p>Use the first transaction in this lesson for reference.</p>

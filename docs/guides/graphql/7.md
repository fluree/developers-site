# Reverse References

In both FlureeQL and GraphQL, you can follow a reference both forwards and backwards. For example, in previous lessons, we saw that `chat/person` is a ref type. In order to see information about a person when we start from the `chat` collection, we would issue a query like the following:

```graphql
{
  graph {
    chat {
      message
      person {
        handle
        fullName
      }
    }
  }
}
```

We can also see information about chats when we start from the `person` collection. In order to do this, we need to include a predicate `chat_Via_person`, and within the curly braces following `chat_Via_person`, we specify any chat predicates we want displayed:

```graphql
{
  graph {
    person {
      chat_Via_person {
        _id
        instant
        message
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<div class="challenge">
<h3>Write a Query!</h3>
<br/>
<p>Write a GraphQL query selecting `person/handle` and `person/fullName` starting from the `artist` collection.</p>

<p>Use the above query for reference.</p>

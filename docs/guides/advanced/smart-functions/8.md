# Predicate Tx Spec

A `_predicate/txSpec` is set of smart functions that are attached to a particular predicate. Any time that predicate appears in a transaction, regardless of who issues the transaction, the smart functions attached to the `_predicate/txSpec` will execute.

If all of the smart functions return true, the transaction will succeed. If any of the smart functions return false, it will fail.

The difference between `_predicate/spec` and `_predicate/txSpec` is that smart functions attached to `_predicate/txSpec` run only once, regardless of how many times that predicate appears in a transaction. For example, you would want to attach a smart function that checks whether a `wallet/balance` is negative to a `_predicate/spec`, because that needs to run once for every `wallet/balance` in the transaction. However, a smart function that, for example, checks that the total amount of balance transacted is under 5,000, should be attached to `_predicate/txSpec`, because that only needs to run once per transaction. This will become clearer when we get into more details about writing smart functions.

## Usage {#usage}

Predicate txSpec are mainly used to ensure that the balance spent is equal to the balance received. You can see an example of this in the [cryptocurrency lesson](/overview/demos/cryptocurrency/1.md).

# The First Block

The first block in every Fluree is automatically written when a new ledger is created. This first block contains a series of [system collections and predicates](/concepts/infrastructure/system_collections.md).

These collections include: `_collection`, `_predicate`, `_auth`, `_block`, and `_tx`.

These flakes set up the collections and predicates that govern a ledger. You can change these initial system collections, for example to allow for [upsert in collections](/overview/schema/collections.mdx#updating-a-predicate-in-_collection). But, we do not recommend changing these system collections unless you have a good understanding of how they work and potential effects.

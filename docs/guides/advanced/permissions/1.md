# Permissions Overview

All permissions in Fluree are governed by smart functions. Smart functions can be attached to predicates, collections, or rules. Smart function are triggered by certain features of a transaction.

In the case of smart functions attached to rules, those smart functions are triggered based on **who** is issuing a given transaction.

If all of the smart functions triggered by a transaction return `true`, then the transaction is considered valid.

If even one of the triggered smart functions returns `false`, the transaction is rejected.

Every ledger comes with two built in smart functions, `["_fn/name", "true"]` and `["_fn/name", "false"]`, which return `true` and `false`, respectively.

In this section of lessons, we won't cover how to write more complicated smart functions. We will just refer to smart functions are returning `true` or `false`, because smart function in the context of permissions should only return `true` or `false`.

This section of lessons corresponds to the [Rules](/concepts/smart-functions/rules.md) section of the docs.

# Signed Endpoints - Part 1

Signed endpoints can be used in both the downloadable and the hosted versions of Fluree.

The main signed endpoints are all structured as follows:

```http
/fdb/[NETWORK-NAME]/[DBNAME-OR-DBID]/[ACTION]
```

In the hosted version, the network is "dev", and the full URL is:

```http
https://db.flur.ee/api/db/[ACCOUNT]/[DBNAME]/[ACTION]
```

In the signed version, the default network is "dev" and the default port is 8090. The full URL, with defaults, is:

```http
http://localhost:8090/fdb/[ACCOUNT]/[DBNAME]/[ACTION]
```

Some of the main endpoints you'll be using are:

`/query` - POST any standard queries in FlureeQL syntax here, including analytical queries.

`/multi-query` - POST any multi-queries in FlureeQL syntax here

`/block` - POST only block queries in FlureeQL syntax. This means queries that return a set of flakes, not standard queries that are performed as of a certain block.

`/history` - POST only history queries in FlureeQL syntax.

{
  "history": ["person/handle", "jdoe"]

# Signatures

This lesson does not go into detail about how to sign your requests. Rather, it explains when you should and shouldn't sign your requests.

The signature should be the SHA2-256 of the original query, signed with your private key, according to [RFC 6979](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6979) standards. For more information on how [signatures](/concepts/identity/signatures.md) are handled in Fluree, visit the Concepts section.

## Signing Queries {#signing-queries}

If `fdb-open-api` is set to true, then you do not need to sign your queries.

If you do need to sign your queries, you should have access to your private key. Your private key needs to be [connected to a valid auth record](/concepts/identity/auth_records.md) in the ledger.

Query signatures belong in the Authorization header.

## Signing Transactions {#signing-transactions}

If `fdb-open-api` is set to true, then you do not need to sign your transactions. If you want to sign your transactions, you should submit a request to the `/cmd` endpoint.

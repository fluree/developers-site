# HTTP Examples

In order to ensure speed of processing queries and transactions, different types of queries and transactions should be issued to different endpoints.
All requests, unless otherwise specified, should be POST requests.

## /ledgers {#ledgers}

A POST request with an empty object or a GET request to `/fdb/ledgers` returns all the ledgers in the transactor group.
These requests do not need to be signed.

An example of an unsigned request to `/ledgers`.

```http
Action: POST or GET
Endpoint: http://localhost:8090/fdb/ledgers
Headers: None
Body: Null
```

## /new-ledger {#new-ledger}

A ledger id must begin with a network name followed by a `/` and a ledger name.  Network
and ledger names may only contain lowercase letters and numbers.  In your request, you
must specify a `ledger/id` key. You may optionally include an `owners` key with a value
of an array of auth ids that you would like bootstrap as root in the new ledger.

If the network specified does not exist, it creates a new network.
This request returns a command id, the request does not wait to ledger to be fully initialized before returning.

These requests do not need to be signed.

```http
Action: POST
Endpoint: http://localhost:8090/fdb/new-ledger
Headers: None
Body: {"ledger/id": "test/one"}
```

## /nw-state {#nw-state}

This provides a status of the Fluree network as recorded by a particular (ledger or transact) server.
Status information includes raft state, list of servers in the Fluree network, list of ledgers, and the current # of transactions queued.

To retrieve the status, simply send an empty POST request to the `/nw-state` endpoint.

```http
Action: POST
Endpoint: http://localhost:8090/fdb/nw-state
Headers: None
Body: None
```

The result is a map of key/value pairs, for example:

```json
{"snapshot-term": 11,
 "latest-index": 19940,
 "snapshot-index": 19800,
 "other-servers": [],
 "index": 19940,
 "snapshot-pending": null,
 "term": 11,
 "leader": "myserver",
 "timeout-at": 1611088055092,
 "this-server": "myserver",
 "status": "leader",
 "id": 88389,
 "svr-state": [{"id": "myserver", "active?": true}],
 "commit": 19940,
 "servers": {"myserver": {"vote": [11 true],
                      "next-index": 19748,
                      "match-index": 19940,
                      "snapshot-index": null,
                      "stats": {"sent": 0, "received": 0, "avg-response": 0}}},
 "raft": {"version": 3,
        "leases": {"servers": {"myserver": {"id": "myserver", "expire": 1611088056918}}},
        "_work": {"networks": {"test": "myserver"}},
        "_worker": {"myserver": {"networks": {"test": 1610570486137}}},
        "cmd-queue": [{"test": 0}],

                                "test/nl-1": {},
                                "nl-2": {"status": "ready", "block": 2, "index": 1, "indexes": {"1": 1610985470087}},
                                "test/nl-2": {}}}}},
 "voted-for": "myserver",
 "open-api": true,
 "timeout-ms": 666}
```

## /export {#export}

This endpoint exports an existing ledger into either `xml` or `ttl`.

You can optionally specify a block (as an integer). If none provided, defaults to the most recent block.
You can optionally specify a format (`xml` or `ttl`). If none provided, defaults to `ttl`.

```http
Action: POST
Endpoint: http://localhost:8090/fdb/dev/main/export
Headers: None
Body: {"format": "ttl"}
```

```http
Action: POST
Endpoint: http://localhost:8090/fdb/dev/main/export
Headers: None
Body: { "format": "xml" , "block": 10 }
```

## /delete-ledger {#delete-ledger}

This deletes a ledger.
Deleting a ledger means that a user will no longer be able to query or transact against that ledger, but currently the actual ledger files will not be deleted on disk.
You can choose to delete those files yourself - or keep them.
You will not be able to create a new ledger with the same name as the deleted ledger.

Use the following request when Fluree server is running in open-api mode (i.e., fdb-api-open=true)

```http
Action: POST
Endpoint: http://localhost:8090/fdb/delete-ledger
Headers: None
Body: {"ledger/id": "NETWORK/DBID"}
```

When the Fluree server is running in closed-api mode (i.e., fdb-api-open=false), the request must be signed.
The process to sign the delete-ledger request is the similar to signing queries and transactions; only the end-point is different.

```http
Action: POST
Endpoint: http://localhost:8090/fdb/delete-ledger
Headers {:content-type :application/json,
           "Digest" "SHA-256=WRw/lfS4v6C7whgUKhbfJPxPQ3wNnRx99NPqDcBCe9M=",
           "X-Fluree-Date" "Wed, 1 Jul 2020 17:38:13 GMT",
           "Signature" "keyId=\"na\",headers=\"(request-target) x-fluree-date digest\",algorithm=\"ecdsa-sha256\",signature=\"1b3044022072efe51f308084a691310824d6065d1b413fcd5d6d7ca310b78e99013db6a08102201485659f379abf8fdf2421e73cb60de2f86394ad22039ec5c8cb475e69b7fc6b\",date=\"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 17:38:13 GMT\""},
 Body: {"ledger/id": "NETWORK/DBID", "auth": "AUTH-ID"}
```

## /query {#query}

All single queries in FlureeQL syntax that include a `select` key should be issued through the `/fdb/[NETWORK-NAME]/[LEDGER-NAME]/query` endpoint.
If you do not have `fdb-api-open` set to true (it is true by default), then you'll need to sign your query ([signing queries](/concepts/identity/signatures.md#signed-queries)).

An example of an unsigned request to `/query` with the network, `dev` and the ledger `main`:

```http
Action: POST
Endpoint: http://localhost:8090/fdb/dev/main/query
Headers: None
Body: { "select": ["*"], "from": "_collection"}
```

An example of a signed request to `/query`:

```http
Action: POST
Endpoint: http://localhost:8090/fdb/dev/main/query
Headers: {
                content-type:       application/json,
                mydate:             Thu, 13 Mar 2019 19:24:22 GMT,
                digest:             SHA-256=ujfvlBjQBa9MNHebH8WpQWP7qQO1L+cI+JH//YvWTq4=,
                signature:          keyId="na",headers="(request-target) host mydate digest",algorithm="ecdsa-sha256",signature="1c3046022100da65438f46df2950b3c6cb931a73031a9dee9faaf1ea8d8dd1d83d5ac026635f022100aabe5483c7bd10c3a468fe720d0fbec256fa3e904e16ff9f330ef13f7921700b"
            }
Body: { "select": ["*"], "from": "_collection"}
```

## /multi-query {#multi-query}

If you are submitting multiple FlureeQL queries at once (using the [multi-query syntax](/overview/query/advanced_query.mdx#multiple-queries)), that should be done through the `/multi-query` endpoint.

An example of an unsigned request to `/multi-query`:

```http
Action: POST
Endpoint: http://localhost:8090/fdb/dev/main/multi-query
Headers: None
Body: { "query1": { "select": ["*"], "from": "_collection"},
        "query2": { "select": ["*"], "from": "_predicate"}}
```

An example of a signed request to `/multi-query`:

```http
Action: POST
Endpoint: http://localhost:8090/fdb/dev/main/multi-query
Headers: {
                content-type:       application/json,
                mydate:             Thu, 13 Mar 2019 19:24:22 GMT,
                digest:             SHA-256=6bc8bd9e8cf3079f2fe7c66b4151745ca80168c89835d9aaef6a79404fcb3018,
                signature:          keyId="na",headers="(request-target) host mydate digest",algorithm="ecdsa-sha256",signature="1c3046022100da65438f46df2950b3c6cb931a73031a9dee9faaf1ea8d8dd1d83d5ac026635f022100aabe5483c7bd10c3a468fe720d0fbec256fa3e904e16ff9f330ef13f7921700b"
            }
Body: { "query1": { "select": ["*"], "from": "_collection"},
        "query2": { "select": ["*"], "from": "_predicate"}}
```

To build the body of this query, create unique names for your queries, and set those as the keys of the your JSON query.
The values of the keys should be the queries themselves.

For example, this query selects all chats and people at once.

```json
{
  "chatQuery": {
    "select": ["*"],
    "from": "chat"
  },
  "personQuery": {
    "select": ["*"],
    "from": "person"
  }
}
```

Any errors will be returned in a header, called `X-Fdb-Errors`.
For example, incorrectCollection is attempting to query a collection that does not exist.

```json
{
  "incorrectCollection": {
    "select": ["*"],
    "from": "apples"
  },
  "personQuery": {
    "select": ["*"],
    "from": "person"
  }
}
```

The response will have a status of 207, and it will only return the response for `personQuery`.

```json
{
    "personQuery": [
      {
        "_id": 4303557230594,
        "person/handle": "zsmith",
        "person/fullName": "Zach Smith",
        "person/karma": 5
      },
      ...
    ]
}
```

## /block {#block}

FlureeQL [block queries](/overview/query/block_query.mdx) should be submitted to the `/block` endpoint. This does not include other types of queries (basic queries, history queries, etc) that might have a "block" key.
This only includes queries like those in the linked section - queries that are returning flakes from a block or set of blocks.

An example of an unsigned request to `/block`:

```http
Action: POST
Endpoint: http://localhost:8090/fdb/dev/main/block
Headers: None
Body: { "block": 5 }
```

## /history {#history}

FlureeQL [history queries](/overview/query/history_query.mdx) should be submitted to the `/history` endpoint.
This only includes queries like those in the linked section.

An example of an unsigned request to `/history`:

```http
Action: POST
Endpoint: http://localhost:8090/fdb/dev/main/history
Headers: None
Body: {
  "history": ["person/handle", "zsmith"],
  "block": 4
}
```

## /transact {#transact}

All unsigned transactions, except transaction issued through the GraphQL syntax, should be issued to the `/fdb/[NETWORK-NAME]/[LEDGER-NAME]/transact` endpoint.

If you do not have `fdb-api-open` set to true (it is true by default), then you cannot use the `/transact` endpoint.
You'll need to use the [`/command` endpoint](#command).

An example of an unsigned request to `/transact`:

```http
Action: POST
Endpoint: http://localhost:8090/fdb/dev/main/transact
Headers: None
Body: [{
    "_id":    "_user",
    "username": "jdoe",
  }]
```

By specifying a `Request-Timeout` header, you can set a transaction timeout.
The maximum transaction size that is currently permitted by Fluree is 2MB.
A sufficiently large transaction can take 50 seconds or longer to be resolved.
By default, your request will timeout after 60 seconds.

An example of setting your own custom timeout is below.
The value provided to `Request-Timeout` is in milliseconds.

```http
Action: POST
Endpoint: http://localhost:8090/fdb/dev/main/transact
Headers: {"Request-Timeout": 10000 }
Body: [{
    "_id":    "_user",
    "username": "jdoe",
  }]
```

## /graphql Query {#graphql}

All queries and transactions in GraphQL syntax should be issued through the `/fdb/[NETWORK-NAME]/[LEDGER-NAME]/graphql` endpoint.
If you do not have `fdb-api-open` set to true (it is true by default), then you'll need to sign your query ([signing queries](/concepts/identity/signatures.md#signed-queries)).

An example of an unsigned request to `/graphql`:

```http
Action: POST
Endpoint: http://localhost:8090/fdb/dev/main/graphql
Headers: None
Body: {"query": "{ graph {
  chat {
    _id
    comments
    instant
    message
    person
  }
}
}"}
```

## /graphql Transaction {#graphql-transaction}

All queries and transactions in GraphQL syntax should be issued through the `/fdb/[NETWORK-NAME]/[LEDGER-NAME]/graphql` endpoint.
If you do not have `fdb-api-open` set to true (it is true by default), then you'll need to sign your GraphQL transaction like a query ([signing queries](/concepts/identity/signatures.md#signed-queries)).

An example of an unsigned request to `/graphql`:

```http
Action: POST
Endpoint: http://localhost:8090/fdb/dev/main/graphql
Headers: None
Body: {"query": "mutation addPeople ($myPeopleTx: JSON) {
  transact(tx: $myPeopleTx)
},
"variables": {
  "myPeopleTx": "[
    { \"_id\": \"person\", \"handle\": \"oRamirez\", \"fullName\": \"Oscar Ramirez\" },
    { \"_id\": \"person\", \"handle\": \"cStuart\", \"fullName\": \"Chana Stuart\" }]"
}}
```

## /sparql {#sparql}

All queries in SPARQL syntax, regardless of type, should be issued through the `/fdb/[NETWORK-NAME]/[LEDGER-NAME]/sparql` endpoint.
If you do not have `fdb-api-open` set to true (it is true by default), then you'll need to sign your query ([signing queries](/concepts/identity/signatures.md#signed-queries)).

An example of an unsigned request to `/sparql`:

```http
Action: POST
Endpoint: http://localhost:8090/fdb/dev/main/sparql
Headers: None
Body: "SELECT ?chat ?message ?person ?instant ?comments
 WHERE {
    ?chat   fd:chat/message  ?message;
            fd:chat/person   ?person;
            fd:chat/comments ?comments;
            fd:chat/instant  ?instant.
 }"
```

## /sql {#sql}

All queries in SQL syntax should be issued through the `/fdb/[NETWORK-NAME]/[LEDGER-NAME]/sql` endpoint.
If you do not have `fdb-api-open` set to true (it is true by default), then you'll need to sign your query ([signing queries](/concepts/identity/signatures.md#signed-queries)).

An example of an unsigned request to `/sql`:

```http
Action: POST
Endpoint: http://localhost:8090/fdb/dev/main/sql
Headers: None
Body: "SELECT ?chat ?message ?person ?instant ?comments
 WHERE {
    ?chat   fd:chat/message  ?message;
            fd:chat/person   ?person;
            fd:chat/comments ?comments;
            fd:chat/instant  ?instant.
 }"
```

## /command {#command}

To see examples of sending a request to the `/command` endpoint, see [signed transactions](/concepts/identity/signatures.md#signed-transactions).

## /reindex {#reindex}

Available in `0.11.7` or higher.
Reindexes the specified ledger.

```http
Action: POST
Endpoint: http://localhost:8090/fdb/dev/main/reindex
Headers: None
Body: None
```

This request may take some time to return.
It will return a map, such as the following:

```json
{
  "block": 13,
  "t": -27,
  "stats": {
    "flakes": 899990,
    "size": 41435614,
    "indexed": 13
  }
}
```

## /reindex-fulltext {#reindex-fulltext}

```http
Action: POST
Endpoint: http://localhost:8090/fdb/dev/main/reindex-fulltext
Headers: None
Body: None
```

This request may take some time to return.
It will return a map, such as the following:

```json
{
  "block": 13,
  "t": -27,
  "stats": {
    "flakes": 899990,
    "size": 41435614,
    "indexed": 13
  }
}
```

## /hide {#hide}

This is a beta feature.
To read about how it works, visit [hiding flakes](/concepts/infrastructure/mutability.md#hiding-flakes).

```http
Action: POST
Endpoint: http://localhost:8090/fdb/dev/main/hide
Headers: None
Body: {
  "hide": [387028092977154, "comment/message", "bad comment"],
    "local": true
}
```

## /gen-flakes {#gen-flakes}

Returns the list of flakes that would be added to a ledger if a given transaction is issued.
The body of this request is simply the transaction.
Note that this is a test endpoint.
This does _NOT_ write the returned flakes to the ledger.

```http
Action: POST
Endpoint: http://localhost:8090/fdb/dev/main/gen-flakes
Headers: None
Body: [{
    "_id":    "person",
    "handle": "joanne",
  }]
```

## /query-with {#query-with}

Returns the results of a query using the existing ledger flakes, including flakes that are provided with the query.

The request expects a map with two key-value pairs:

| Key      | Value                                                                            |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `flakes` | An array of valid flakes                                                         |
| `query`  | A query to issue against the current ledger plus the flakes in the flakes value. |

The `t` on the flakes provided has to be current with the latest ledger.
For example, if you used `gen-flakes`, but then issued a transaction, you will need to use `gen-flakes` again to generate new valid flakes.

```http
Action: POST
Endpoint: http://localhost:8090/fdb/dev/main/query-with
Headers: None
Body: {
  "query": {"select": ["*"], "from": "person"},
  "flakes": [[351843720888321, 1002, "JoAnne", -5, true, nil]]}
```

## /test-transact-with {#test-transact-with}

Given a valid set of flakes that could be added to the ledger at a given point in time and a transaction, returns the flakes that would be added to a ledger if a given transaction is issued.

The request expects a map with the following key-value pairs:

| Key      | Value                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `flakes` | An array of valid flakes                                                                                                                                      |
| `txn`    | A transaction to issue against the current ledger plus the flakes in the flakes value. This endpoint does _NOT_ actually write the transaction to the ledger. |
| `auth`   | (Optional) The `_auth/id` with which to issue the transaction.                                                                                                |

The `t` on the flakes provided has to be current with the latest ledger.
For example, if you used `gen-flakes`, but then issued a transaction, you will need to use `gen-flakes` again to generate new valid flakes.

```http
Action: POST
Endpoint: http://localhost:8090/fdb/dev/main/test-transact-with
Headers: None
Body: {
  "tx": [{ "_id": "person", "handle": "kReeves" }],
  "flakes": [[351843720888321, 1002, "JoAnne", -5, true, nil]]}
```

## /block-range-with-txn {#block-range-with-txn}

A POST request to `/fdb/[NETWORK-NAME]/[DBID]/block-range-with-txn` returns block stats, as well as flakes and transactions for the specified block(s).

```http
Action: POST
Endpoint: http://localhost:8090/fdb/dev/main/block-range-with-txn
Headers: None
Body: {
  "start": 1,
  "end": 2}
```

## /health {#health}

A GET request to `/fdb/health` returns whether the server is ready or not.
You are not able to test this endpoint in the sidebar.
These requests do not need to be signed.

```http
Action: GET
Endpoint: http://localhost:8090/fdb/health
```

## /garbage-collect-ledger {#garbage-collect-ledger}

A POST request to `/fdb/garbage-collect-ledger` with valid ledger ID contained in the payload will initiate the garbage collection process for the specified ledger, if needed.
This process is useful for freeing up disk space for ledgers which have had a large number of transactions or re-indexing operations.
Any "stale" index nodes that are no longer needed by the ledger will be removed from storage.

```http
Action: POST
Endpoint: http://localhost:8090/fdb/garbage-collect-ledger
Body: {
  "ledger/id": "test/dev"
}
```

There will be no response until the ledger has completed the operation.
Once garbage collection is completed, the response will resemble the example below.

```json
{
  "garbage-collected": "test/dev"
}
```

If there was no "garbage" to collect, the response will look like this.

```json
{
  "no-garbage": "test/dev"
}
```

## /ledger-stats {#ledger-stats}

A POST request to `/fdb/[NETWORK-NAME]/[DBID]/ledger-stats` provides stats about the requested ledger.

```http
Action: POST
Endpoint: http://localhost:8090/fdb/dev/main/ledger-stats
Headers: None
Body: None
```

## /storage {#storage}

A GET request to `/fdb/storage/[NETWORK-NAME]/[LEDGER-NAME]/[TYPE]` returns all key-value pairs of a certain type.
You are not able to test this endpoint in the sidebar.
These requests do not need to be signed.

```http
Action: GET
Endpoint: http://localhost:8090/fdb/storage/[NETWORK-NAME]/[LEDGER-NAME]/[TYPE]
```

A GET request to `/fdb/storage/[NETWORK-NAME]/[LEDGER-NAME]/[TYPE]/[KEY]` returns the value for the provided key.

```http
Action: GET
Endpoint: http://localhost:8090/fdb/storage/[NETWORK-NAME]/[LEDGER-NAME]/[TYPE]/[KEY]
```

## /sub {#sub}

A POST request to `/fdb/sub` handles subscriptions.
More documentation on this feature coming soon.
You are not able to test this endpoint in the sidebar.
These requests do not need to be signed.

## /new-keys {#new-keys}

A POST request with an empty object or a GET request to `/fdb/new-keys` returns a valid public key, private key, and auth-id.
Learn more about [how identity is established in Fluree](/concepts/identity/auth_records.md#generating-a-public-private-key-auth-id-triple).
These requests do not need to be signed.

## /pw/generate {#pwgenerate}

See the [Password Management Guide](/concepts/identity/password_management.md) for more information.

Once you've [logged in](./logging-in.mdx), there will always be a *Create New* button in the top right corner of the screen that will let you create a new dataset from anywhere in the app.
In the screenshot below, the *Create New* button is seen as the "+" icon button in the top right corner of the screen, just to the left of your Fuel Gauge and Profile Menu.

| Dataset Name | A short name to identify your dataset. It must be at least 4 characters long and only consist of letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores. |
| Description (optional) | Provide more details or instructions for your new dataset. This can be edited after dataset creation. |
| Tags (optional) | Give your dataset text tags to make it more discoverable. These can be edited after dataset creation. |

Once you've filled out the form, click the "Create Dataset" button. 
After a few seconds, you'll be taken to the [Dataset screen](../datasets/overview.mdx) where you can begin adding and working with your data.

  />
</FigureWithCaption>

<Admonition type="info">
When selecting a username, keep in mind that this will become a public identifier for your account.

In the future, if you make your datasets public or share them selectively with other individuals / organizations, this username will identify you (much like a GitHub username identifies you and your repositories on GitHub).
</Admonition>

## Email and Password

If creating an account with an email and password, simply fill out the form entirely, and submit.
Once your account is created, you will be authenticated and taken to the main dashboard.

## Google or GitHub

<Admonition type="info">
If registering an account with Google or GitHub, keep in mind that subsequent login attempts will require you to use the same method.
</Admonition>

You can also register a new account using your Google or GitHub account by using the corresponding icons at the bottom of the form.

<FigureWithCaption caption='Third-Party registration options. Google is on the left, GitHub on the right.'>
  <Image
    className="shadow-lg"
    img={oauthIcons}
    alt="Third Party Registration Options"
  />
</FigureWithCaption>

After authenticating against either Google or GitHub, you will be prompted to supply a username for your account. After supplying a valid username, you will be taken to the main dashboard.

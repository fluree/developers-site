## Path to your Chat-enabled Dataset
Fluree Cloud is built to be your easiest path to working with your data. You have a few options for layering a *Fluree Data Model* into your dataset.
Choose the path that matches your source data and follow the guide with the goal of defining a data model that's compatible with the <span className="text-ui-main-500 font-bold">Fluree Data Agent</span>.
 1. **Upload Documents (*this guide*)**  
    You have unstructured documents like PDFs, Word docs, or text files.
 1. [Upload Tables](./with-structured.mdx)  
    You have structured data from a relational database export or in a spreadsheet or set of CSV files.
 {/* 1. [Bring your own Ontology](./with-ontology.mdx)  
    You have a custom ontology or data model that you want to use. */}


### Path: Upload Documents
Choose this option if you have text documents in one of the following file formats: 
- Plain Text or Markdown (`.txt`, `.md`)
- Word (`.doc`, `.docx`)
- PDF (`.pdf`)
- HTML (`.htm`, `.html`).

At a high level, Fluree Cloud uses custom ensembles of machine learning models to extract entities and relationships against a combination of widely-used general ontologies we refer to as the *General Knowledge Model*.
This method is best at analyzing files concerned with people, places, and things and the relationships among them. Think Wikipedia articles, news articles, or academic papers.
Files that contain images, tables, or other non-textual data won't produce the best results with our current ML models.

Simply upload your text documents and our suite of automated data services will generate a localized "slice" of the *General Knowledge Model* that is specific to your data (this will become your *Fluree Data Model*) which will be used to extract structured data for you to transact to your dataset.

Here's the step-by-step.
1. **Navigate to your new dataset**  
If you've just created your new dataset, you're already on your Dataset page. 
If not, navigate to [your Datasets screen](https://data.flur.ee/datasets) and click on your new, empty dataset.

2. **Call up the `Files` tab**  
Click on the `Files` entry in the dataset menu on the left of the screen. This will open the `Files` tab for your dataset.

    />
  </div>

3. **Upload your text files**  
Either drag and drop one or more text files onto the window or click on the `Select Files` button in the top right of the `Files` tab.
Only the following file extensions will be accepted at this time: `.txt`, `.md`, `.doc`, `.docx`, `.pdf`, `.htm`, `.html`.

4. **Process your text files**  
After your file has been uploaded, the Action button on the file's record will change to `Process`. 
Click this button to kick off the automated extraction process. Depending on the size of this file, this process may take some time.
Feel free to navigate away from this screen and return later to check on the progress.

The screenshot above also includes a light-blue arrow that indicates a switch you can use to automatically process and transact the data from uploaded files without having to manually take action to move the process along.

5. **View and transact your extracted data**  
When the processing of your file is complete, the Status column will indicate "Processed" and the Action button will change to `Transact`.
You can click on the vertical ellipsis icon to the right of the `Transact` button to expose a submenu where you can `Download JSON` to see your extracted data.
If everything looks good, click the `Transact` button to add the extracted data to your dataset.

      className="shadow-xl"
    />
  </div>
</FigureWithCaption>

6. **Browse your data in `View Data` and chat with your data in `Chat`**  
After you've transacted your data, you can navigate to the `View Data` tab to see your data in a tabular format by clicking on the `View Data` button on the file record or by clicking on the `View Data` menu item in the left-hand dataset menu.
We recommend you browse the data in your dataset to get an idea of what concepts, terms, and relationships were extracted from your text files. This is the context the Data Agent will have when you chat with your data.
When you're ready to chat with your data, click on the plus button on the `Chat` menu item in the left-hand dataset menu to create a new chat.

## Path to your Chat-enabled Dataset
Fluree Cloud is built to be your easiest path to working with your data. You have a few options for layering a *Fluree Data Model* into your dataset.
Choose the path that matches your source data and follow the guide with the goal of defining a data model that's compatible with the <span className="text-ui-main-500 font-bold">Fluree Data Agent</span>.
 1. [Upload Documents](./with-unstructured.mdx)  
    You have unstructured documents like PDFs, Word docs, or text files.
 1. [Upload Spreadsheets](./with-structured.mdx)  
    You have structured data from a relational database export or in a spreadsheet or set of CSV files.
 1. **Bring your own Ontology (*this guide*)**  
    You have a custom ontology or data model that you want to use.

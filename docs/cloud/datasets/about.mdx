  The following is an overview of the `About` tab within the Dataset View.

## Overview

The `About` tab serves as a landing page for each individual dataset. It provides a high-level overview of the dataset, similar to how a `README` file in GitHub serves as a landing page for a repository.

Because it is possible to share your dataset, either publicly or with particular collaborators, the `About` tab also serves as a place to provide information about the dataset to those who may not be familiar with it.

Clicking on the `Edit` button will allow you to change the `Name`, `Description`, `Read Me`, and `Tags` fields.

## Name, Description, & Read Me

This is where you can edit the information associated with your dataset. The `Description` field is a simple text field, while the `Read Me` field allows Markdown.

## Tags

Tags can be used to help with dataset discovery.

<FigureWithCaption>
  <div className="flex flex-row justify-around">
    <Image
      img={tagsEdit}
      alt="A view of the tags field in edit mode"
      className="shadow-xl"
    />
  </div>
</FigureWithCaption>

Once you have typed in the text for your tag, press the Enter key to add it to the tag component. You will still need to click the `Save Changes` button to apply the change to the dataset.

      img={tagsSaved}
      alt="A view of the tags field in edit mode with a new tag added"
      className="shadow-xl"
    />
  </div>
</FigureWithCaption>

## Collaborators

The `Collaborators` section of the `About` tab provides a list of all of the users who have access to the dataset.

Here the `Collaborators` section is read-only. To add or remove collaborators, you will need to use the [Settings](/docs/cloud/datasets/settings) tab.

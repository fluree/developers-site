Being able to see your data is valuable, but being able to **update** that data is just as important, if not more so.

## UI Mode

<TableCellsIcon className="h-12 w-12 text-fluree-blue" />

If you have registered a schema using SHACL class shapes, you can use the Nexus UI tools to create new subjects in those classes.

<FigureWithCaption caption="Adding a new movie instance.">
  <Image
    className="shadow-lg"
    img={highlightAddInstances}
    alt="The class selection interface with 'add instances' highlighted"
  />
</FigureWithCaption>

Clicking "add instances" will take you to a page with a form that is populated with input fields based on the declared types of each class property.
Click the "+ Add Instance" button, fill out the appropriate input fields, and hit the "Transact" button at the bottom of the form.

<FigureWithCaption caption="Add new data with dynamically created forms based on your SHACL Class shape definitions!">
  <Image
    className="shadow-lg"
    img={addMovie}
    alt="A form for creating new instances of the ex:Movie class"
  />
</FigureWithCaption>

You can even add multiple instances in the same transactions, by clicking on the "+ Add Instance" button again.
Once you hit the transact button, your new instances will be committed to your dataset.

## Editor Mode

<CodeBracketIcon className="h-12 w-12 text-fluree-blue" />

In the editor mode, make sure that it is set to "Transact" mode.

<FigureWithCaption caption='Be sure to click the "Transact" tab directly above the editor.'>
  <Image
    className="shadow-lg"
    alt="The data management editor with an error highlighting the Transact tab"
    img={highlightTx}
  />
</FigureWithCaption>

From here, you can place any valid transactable data inside the `txn` object, and then click the "Transact" button to commit your data to the dataset.

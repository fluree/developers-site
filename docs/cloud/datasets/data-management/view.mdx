Nexus now offers two ways to view your data: [UI mode](#ui-mode) and [editor mode](#editor-mode)

## UI Mode

<TableCellsIcon className="h-12 w-12 text-fluree-blue" />

This mode will allow you to [select](#selection) data using a checkbox-driven interface.
Retrieved data is [viewed](#view) as a paginated table.

### Selection

If SHACL class shapes have been registered within a dataset, they will appear in an expandable tree view on this page.
In the first image below, you can see a demo dataset that features several classes related to a film catalog.
The `ex:movie` class is expanded, and the class's properties (and their data types) are displayed below.
Checking the box next to the class name will select / de-select all of the classes properties.

The second image below shows the "properties" view.
This view shows _all_ properties that are present in a dataset, and allow you to query any records that contain each selected property.

<FigureWithCaption caption="The two primary methods for retrieving data.">
  <div className="flex flex-row justify-around">
    <Image
      img={collectionDrawer}
      alt="An expanding tree view of several data classes"
      className="w-2/5 shadow-xl"
    />
    <Image
      img={propertyView}
      alt="A list of data properties with accompanying checkboxes"
      className="w-2/5 shadow-xl"
    />
  </div>
</FigureWithCaption>

The "Keyword Filter" box can be used to refine the classes / properties displayed at any given time, which can be handy if a dataset contains a wide variety of data types.

### View

Requested data will be viewable in a simple table format, with column names based on the selected properties.

  />
</FigureWithCaption>

#### Time Travel Toolbar

Using this toolbar in conjunction with the class and property selectors, a user can view the state of their data at any given point during its lifetime.

</FigureWithCaption>

| Button                                                 | Function                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <BackwardIcon className="h-6 w-6 text-fluree-blue" />  | Move backward one transaction                                             |
| <ForwardIcon className="h-6 w-6 text-fluree-blue" />   | Move forward one transaction                                              |
| <ClockIcon className="h-6 w-6 text-fluree-blue" />     | Use a date & time picking input to specify a chronological moment in time |
| <ArrowPathIcon className="h-6 w-6 text-fluree-blue" /> | Reset the time to the most current transaction                            |

## Editor Mode

<CodeBracketIcon className="h-12 w-12 text-fluree-blue" />

The editor is where you can create custom queries using the provided text editor.
You also have the ability to save your queries, and to the right of the query editor you can locate recent queries and saved queries.

Currently, only queries using FlureeQL are supported, but SPARQL query support is in the pipeline.

    className="shadow-lg"
  />

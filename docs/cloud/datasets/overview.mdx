# Overview

<div class="overview">
  The following is an overview of the `Dataset View`. We will explore
  the various tabs and their functionality.
</div>

---

## Introduction

You can manage your datasets using the `Dataset View`. This UI is accessible by clicking any dataset on the datasets page.

<Admonition type="note">
  If you have just created a new dataset, you will be automatically redirected
  to the `Dataset View`.
</Admonition>

We will step through each of the tabs in the `Dataset View`. They include:

- **[`About`](../about/)**: General information about the dataset, including a `readme`, `tags`, `context`, and associated `collaborators`.
  {/* - **[`Data`](../view-data/)**: A managed view of the data in your dataset by `class` or by `property`. */}
- **`Models`**: Upload a data model as a blueprint of your data structures.
- **`Files`**: Transact PDF and csv to quickly and easily get your data into Fluree.
- **[`Policies`](../policies/)**: UI for managing the `access control policies` for your dataset.
- **[`Settings`](../settings/)**: Settings for your dataset, including management for `collaborators` and `API keys` for application integration.
- **[`Notebooks`](../notebooks/)**: UI for organizing and saving sets of `queries`, `transactions`, and notes, for your own use or to share with others.
- **`Queries`**: UI for querying and transacting against your dataset. See our [Cookbook of Query Examples](/docs/reference/cookbook/#querying) for examples.
- **[`Chats`](../how-to/chat/intro.mdx)**: Ask questions and explore your data using a natural language interface grounded in your dataset's structure.

## Working with a New Dataset

When you first create a new dataset, you will be automatically redirected to the [`notebooks`](../notebooks/) screen with a `Quick Start Guide` notebook.

<Admonition type="tip">
  If you prefer to learn about working with data in Fluree through a hands-on
  experience, the `Quick Start Guide` notebook is a great place to start.
</Admonition>

The `Quick Start Guide` notebook will walk you through the following steps:

1. **Adding Sample Data**
2. **Querying the Data**
3. **Querying for Linked / Relational Data**
4. **Issuing Advanced Queries**
   - **Time-Travel Queries**
   - **Semantic Inferencing**

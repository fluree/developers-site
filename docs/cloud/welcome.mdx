The Fluree Data Agent is a powerful tool that allows you to interact with your data using natural language.
Grounded in the structure of your dataset, the Data Agent generates queries to answer your complex questions while providing traceability features so you can be confident in the results.

### [Create a Dataset](./getting-started/create-new-dataset.mdx)
You can create a new dataset by clicking on the `plus icon` button in the top right corner of any screen in Fluree Cloud.

### [Settings](./datasets/settings.mdx)
The Settings tab is where you can transition ownership or delete your dataset. 
You can also manage your collaborators and API Keys from this tab.

### [Notebooks](./datasets/notebooks.mdx)
Notebooks are an organizational tool for users to save a multi-step interaction with a dataset. 
Using a Notebook you can run and save queries and transactions alongside accompanying Markdown, making it easy to document your own work and share it with others.

### [Policies](./datasets/policies.mdx)
Policies are used by Fluree to determine who can access what data in your dataset.
Fluree Cloud provides an easy-to-use and powerful builder interface that allows you to create and manage policies and policy groups for your dataset.
